# Codeberg
Collection of smaller codes. Slightly sorted, unnumbered ones are usually very simple while numbered ones are more interesting. I´ve added functionality comments on most codes before the main-method

This is my codeberg where I´ve stored many of my beginner codes. 
Its slightly ordered so that numbered ones are usually more interesting (1 more - 1+n less).
Unnumbered codes are usually very simple.
